    <h2 align="left">About Me</h2>
    <p align="left">I am Hiranmay, a research scholar in Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore pursuing my interest in condensed matter theory. I am broadly interested in the quantum mechanical phenomena in condensed matter systems. Currenlty I am working on random pi-flux model and investigating whether disorder can cause transition from small to large fermi surfaces.

    <h2 align="left">About the WebDiary</h2>
    <p align="left">I always felt the need of documenting my progress and this WebDiary surves that very purpose. I enlist my thoughts about certain things and speak about my experience of learning a skill or reading a book, on a regular basis. Basically it has the contents that I think would be useful for a show-off.
